Mapty // Map Your Workouts
Overview````
Mapty is a web application designed to help users track and visualize their workouts on a map. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Leaflet library to create an interactive map.

Functionalities
Workout Form
The application features a workout form that allows users to input details about their workout, including:

Type (Running or Cycling)
Distance (in kilometers)
Duration (in minutes)
Cadence (in steps per minute)
Elevation Gain (in meters)
The form is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear labels and placeholders to guide the user through the input process.

Workout List
Once a workout is submitted, it is added to the workout list, which displays the following information:

Workout type (icon and text)
Distance and unit
Duration and unit
Cadence and unit
Elevation gain and unit
The workout list is designed to be easy to read and understand, with clear and concise information about each workout.

Map Visualization
The application uses Leaflet to create an interactive map that displays the user's workouts. Each workout is represented by a marker on the map, which can be clicked to view the workout details.

The map is fully interactive, allowing users to zoom in and out, pan, and click on markers to view more information.

Filtering and Sorting
The workout list can be filtered by workout type (Running or Cycling) and sorted by distance, duration, or elevation gain.

This feature allows users to quickly and easily view specific types of workouts or sort their workouts by different criteria.
